## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Query


### What I learned

- Using flexbox for layout and flex direction property
- Using theoverflow property to define the edges on a child element
- Using media query to create a fairly responsive layout

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
```css
 @media (max-width: 900px){
  .section{
    flex-direction: column;
    width: min-content;
    border-radius: 10px;
    overflow: hidden;
  }
```

### Continued development
- The flexbox seem apowerful tool which I'm still learning about
- Media Queries to create even more responnsive layout
- Min-width, max-width, 

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - This helped me learn about flexbox and how to go about using it. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Learn CSS](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
